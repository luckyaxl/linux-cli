# Frontend Master Intro Linux and Command Line

### What is UNIX
Unix is considered as the mother of most of the operating systems.

The design of Unix systems is based on “Unix Philosophy” which includes the following characteristics:

- Usage of plain text for data storage.
- Hierarchical file system.
- Handling devices and some specific kinds of inter-process communication (IPC) as files.
- Employing a huge number of software tools.
- Multiple small, simple and modular programs which can be threaded together via a command-line interpreter using pipes, contrasting to use a single monolithic program which comprises of all the same functionality.
### What is Linux
Linux is a Unix based operating system. That means it derives heavenly inspiration from Unix without actually being Unix. They are actually very different concepts. macOS and FreeBSD would be two more examples of a Unix-like operating system.

### Why Linux?
Because you can install Linux on as many computers as you like without paying a cent for software or server licensing.
